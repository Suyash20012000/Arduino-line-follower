# Arduino-line-follower/Obstacle detector
**This is an implementation of IR sensors ans Servo motors which are controlled using arduino.This was a basic project implemented to explore the Microcontrollers.This was modified into a line follower which previously was just a Obastacle detector having a UV distance sensor.**
